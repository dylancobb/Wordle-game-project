# Wordle Game

This repository contains my implementation of the Wordle word game. The goal of this project is to create a simplified version of the game, focusing on specific user stories as part of a coding challenge.

## Project Overview 🗺️

The Wordle game is a word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a five-letter word within a limited number of attempts. The game provides feedback on the correctness of the guess by highlighting correct letters in the correct positions (green) and correct letters in the wrong positions (yellow).

## User Stories 👥

In order to tackle this challenge in an Agile fashion, I broke down the development tasks into the following user stories:

1. Display Game Interface
    1a. Mobile-Friendly Design
2. Validate Player Guess
3. Check Guess against the Target Word
4. Track Remaining Attempts
5. Provide Game Over Condition
6. Allow Restarting the Game
7. Same Daily Word For All Users

## Development Process 🛠️

To start working on the project, I followed these steps:

1. Created a new GitHub repository to host the project.
2. Created separate issues on the repository for each user story.
3. Prioritized the user stories and selected one to focus on for the take-home challenge, with a mind to work on additional user stories if time permits.
4. Started implementing the selected user story, making incremental commits along the way.
5. Documented the process, challenges, and decisions in this README file.

## Progress 📈

- Project created.
- README created.
- Folder structure and tentative boilerplate code implemented.
- Plan of action worked out in the form of the above README 😊
